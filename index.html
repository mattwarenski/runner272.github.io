        <h2>Welcome to random things I learned!</h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">This site is dedicated to keeping track of all of those random facts
          that you learned. Facts that can't be rembered but are useful enough
          that you don't want to look them up a hundred times.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
          This site is currently under cunstruction but in the end will feature a
          way to add things and to group them together. As well as many other things.
